# 🌾 Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning

This project aims to build a machine learning-based crop recommendation system that suggests the most suitable crop to cultivate based on environmental and soil conditions. It leverages exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and SHAP for interpretability.

## 📌 Project Overview

Agriculture is a backbone of many economies, and choosing the right crop for a given set of conditions can significantly improve yield and sustainability. This project uses machine learning to recommend crops based on features like:

- Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH level
- Rainfall

## 🧪 Workflow Summary

### 1. 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized distributions and relationships between features
- Identified correlations and outliers
- Used plots like histograms, pairplots, heatmaps for insights

### 2. 🤖 Model Building
- Trained multiple classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, KNN)
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall
- Selected the best-performing model for deployment

### 3. 📈 Model Interpretation with SHAP
- Applied SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to understand feature importance
- Visualized how each feature contributes to crop prediction
- Enhanced model transparency for stakeholders
